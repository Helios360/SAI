What is the SAI project...

SAI (Supplementary Assist Intelligence) aims to help users for multiple tasks, first let’s talk about the hardware:
  - Frontal chest camera for security and AI functionality like, face recognition, movement detection and environmental scanning
  - A headset, speakers and mic and alternate reality (since using those together will make exeperience smoother)
  - Built in self defense tools like a taser and bright leds
  - A mask for air purification
  - A monocle that can display essential data
  - An on-arm display to control the system and access the homelab computer
  - Enough battery to power the system for atleast 1,5days (on rasp pi 5 plus internet hat)

The portable mods on screen:
  - media control for headset or speaker
  - resources monitoring
  - switch to CLI
  - sensor and camera control/view
  - communication via network to the main home computer

The main computer will have multiple task:
  - Unifying all incoming messages from socials like instagram (so I don’t have insta on my phone anymore since I can’t live without it), from Gmail and others for conveniance
  - A webserver so that I can let my friends use some features or something similar
  - Tools for Computer science in general and tools I’ve created could be executed and used on the computer via the "phone"
  - Access to the local network NAS as a database
  - A local llm like llama3 or some to talk to (like JARVIS) i must make a deep search one too (on homelab)
  - Of course all this containerized on arch (for bleeding edge tech) on a proxmox base for versatility and reliability

THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT : 
I'd like to implement AI and technologies to another level, higher than a traditionnal phone, one that i have full control over, to help me be more productive and faster (and also pretty cool :D)
