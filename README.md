What is the SAI project...

The SAI (Supplementary Assist Intelligence) aims to help users for multiple tasks, first let’s talk about the hardware:
  - Omni directional camera on the shoulder for security and AI functionality like, face recognition or movement detection
  - A headset, speakers and mic which can work together
  - Built in self defense tools like a taser and bright leds
  - A mask for air purification
  - A monocle that can display essential data
  - A arm display to control the system and access the main computer
  - Enough battery to power the system for atleast 1,5days
  (I’d like to implement electric retractable rollers but at the end)

The portable phone integrated in the armor will used as an interface multiple controls:
  - media control for headset or speaker
  - resources monitoring
  - switch to CLI
  - sensor and camera control
  - communication via network to the main home computer

The main computer will have multiple task:
  - Unifying all incoming messages from socials like instagram (so I don’t have insta on my phone anymore since I can’t live without it), from Gmail and others for conveniance
  - A webserver so that I can let my friends use some features or something similar
  - Tools for Computer science in general and tools I’ve created could be executed and used on the computer via the phone
  - Access to the local network NAS as a database
  - A local llm like llama3 or some to talk to like JARVIS in Iron Man

VERY IMPORTANT !!!!   :    The Main computer and the phone got to stay in a live connection during the whole use time or the product can’t be used completely even though it doesn’t impact the phone control on the armor 

THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT : 
I don’t want to get a chipset planted on my brain like neuralink, I want to create a tool I can trust with my data, in reliability and that I can totally customize, to let it be personal, open source and efficient.
The first idea here was to create a way for humans to go beyond what they can do by giving them an assistant that helps in every day's tasks as much as dangerous or complex situations. :3
